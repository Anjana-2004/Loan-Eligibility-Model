# Loan-Eligibility-Model
The Loan Eligibility Model uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict loan approval based on features like income, loan amount, CIBIL score, and education level. It preprocesses data by handling missing values and encoding variables, providing interpretable predictions for assessing loan eligibility for new applicants.
